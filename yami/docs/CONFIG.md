# Configuration reference

Everything the settings window changes is a key in a plain JSON file; editing the file by hand
works the same and is picked up live. A key with a bad value falls back to its default (the rest
of the file is kept), unknown keys are ignored: `yami-shell config check` lists both.

| File | Owner | Edit by hand |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.config/yami-shell.json` | the shell; yami-files, yami-view and `tools/theme.py` read the look from it | yes, live |
| `~/.config/yami-files.json` | yami-files | yes (read at start) |
| `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` | the installer | better not: it is replaced on reinstall |
| `~/.config/niri/user.kdl` | **you** | yes: included last, wins over everything above |
| `~/.config/niri/yami-binds.kdl` | the shell (settings → keys) | no, rewritten |
| `~/.config/niri/yami-fx.kdl` | the shell (windows, look, games) | no, rewritten |
| `~/.config/niri/yami-colors.kdl`, `yami-cursor.kdl` | `tools/theme.py` | no, rewritten |
| `~/.config/niri/yami-outputs.kdl` | the shell (settings → screens) | no, rewritten |
| `~/.config/niri/yami-local.kdl` | the installer (GPU environment) | no |
| `~/.local/state/yami/palette.json` | the shell: the derived palette other apps are coloured from | no |
| `~/.config/xdg-desktop-portal/niri-portals.conf` | the shell (settings → services); kept as is once it no longer starts with `# yami:` | through the settings |
| `~/.local/state/yami/install.json` | the installer and `tools/deploy.sh`: version, commit, source, components | no |
| `~/.local/state/yami/update.json` | the last update check | no |

## The terminal

`yami` is the same binary as `yami-shell` (a link in `~/.local/bin`): without a command it
prints the help instead of starting the shell. `yami help <command>` explains one command.

```sh
yami open settings:updates                # a panel: launcher clipboard settings[:tab] power lock screenshot cal sound net bt sys
yami palette | yami palette ash | yami palette '#3a9fd0'
yami wallpaper ~/Pictures/x.png           # no path: the palette's pixel wallpaper
yami restart                              # restart the shell (refuses while a game has focus; --force)
yami status                               # shell, portal, niri, last update check
yami doctor                               # programs, D-Bus services, config: what is missing and what it costs
yami clean [--dry-run]                    # remove the build cache (yami-niri sources, the shell's target: gigabytes); --force also drops a tree with your patch work
yami version                              # every part with the installed commit
yami update [check|apply|list|to X.Y.Z|rollback|status|log]
yami msg <command>                        # raw shell command (yami help msg)
yami-shell config list                    # every key = value; * marks what differs from the default
yami-shell config get dockPins
yami-shell config set dockSide '"left"'   # VALUE is JSON; a bare word is taken as a string
yami-shell config set animSpeed 0.7
yami-shell config reset dockSide          # one key back to its default
yami-shell config reset                   # the whole file (the old one is kept as .json.bak)
yami-shell config check                   # bad values and unknown keys
yami-shell config kdl                     # what the shell writes to yami-fx.kdl
yami-shell binds list | print | write     # keybindings
```

### Windows, dock, screenshots, system

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|

|---|---|---|
| `gameFullscreen` | `true` | game windows (Steam/Proton `steam_app_*`, `gamescope`, `gameApps`) open fullscreen |
| `gameVrr` | `true` | VRR while a game is on screen (the output's VRR set to «in games», settings → screens) |

| `gameApps` | `""` | your games' app-ids, comma separated; `name*` matches the start |

### Services

What on D-Bus and in the portals yami does itself. Turned off, it is left to another program
(mako or dunst, waybar's tray, polkit-gnome, the GTK/GNOME portals). Notifications, tray and
polkit change after a shell restart (`yami restart`), portals from the next login.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `agentNotif` | `true` | the notification server (`org.freedesktop.Notifications`) |
| `agentTray` | `true` | the tray (`org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher`, at most 64 items) |
| `agentPolkit` | `true` | the polkit password window |
| `notifMax`, `notifHistory` | `4`, `50` | cards on screen at once; how many the history keeps |
| `notifImages` | `true` | pictures in cards (icons and previews; at most 1024², files ≤ 16 MB) |
| `notifCast` | `false` | notifications show in recordings and streams; off: viewers never see them (yami-niri ≥ `.5` simply leaves them out, other niri blacks them out) |
| `audioNames` | `{}` | your names for sound devices: PipeWire name (`pactl list short sinks`) → label, e.g. `{"alsa_output.usb-…-00.analog-stereo": "Headphones"}` |
| `mediaArtNet` | `true` | album covers from the player's web links (`curl`, https after redirects, ≤ 16 MB); off: only local files |
| `portalFiles`, `portalCast` | `true`, `true` | file dialogs from yami-files, the screen-share picker from the shell (else GTK / GNOME) |

### Updates

`yami update` and settings → updates work on their own clone, `~/.local/share/yami/src` (your
working copy is never touched). A release is the newest `vX.Y.Z` tag; with `updateChannel`
`main` every commit of the branch is offered. Installing runs `install.sh --update` from the
new tree: it rebuilds from source, keeps every setting and needs no sudo; the previous binaries
go to `~/.local/lib/yami/prev` for `yami update rollback`. `yami update list` shows the last
eight releases with their signatures, `yami update to X.Y.Z` builds and installs one of them (only
what passes `updateVerify`). Before switching to an older version the settings are copied to
`~/.local/state/yami/settings-newer.json`; keys the older version dropped come back from it on the
next switch to a version at least as new. A switch to a whole version also rebuilds yami-niri at
that version's level (from the next login).

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `updateCheck`, `updateEvery` | `true`, `24` | check by itself every N hours (only a check and a card: installing is your click) |
| `updateChannel` | `"release"` | `release` (tags) or `main` (every commit) |
| `updateVerify` | `"auto"` | `auto`: once the installed version has keys in `keys/allowed_signers`, only tags signed by them install; `require`: never unsigned; `off`: no check |
| `updateRepo` | `""` | another repository URL; empty: where the install came from |

### Keys

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `binds` | `{}` | binding id → keys, e.g. `{"terminal": "Mod+Return", "launcher-2": ""}` (`""` turns it off). Ids: `yami-shell binds list` |
| `customBinds` | `[]` | your commands: `[{"key": "Mod+Shift+B", "cmd": "kitty -e btop"}]` (run with `sh -c`) |
| `kbLayout` | `""` | keyboard layouts, xkb codes separated by commas (`"us,ru"`, `"de"`); empty: from the system languages (LANG and LC_*: English gives `us`, every other language adds its layout, non-Latin ones after `us`) |
| `kbSwitch` | `"grp:alt_shift_toggle"` | the xkb option that switches layouts (`grp:ctrl_shift_toggle`, `grp:caps_toggle`, `grp:alt_space_toggle`); empty: no switch |

Keys are written as niri does: `Mod` (Super), `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, then a key name (`Q`,
`Slash`, `Page_Up`, `Print`, `XF86AudioMute`, `WheelScrollDown`). Anything the table cannot
express goes into `~/.config/niri/user.kdl` in plain niri syntax, which wins.

### Widgets

`widgets` is a list of `{"id", "kind", "on", "x", "y", "source", "style", "anim", "size",
"color", "frame", "label", "seconds", "date", "text"}`: `kind` is `clock` `graph` `net` `media`
`cal` `note`; graphs take `source` `cpu` `ram` `temp` `gpu` `swap` and `style` `bars` `line`
`blocks` `wave` `dots`. `x`/`y` of -1 means the default place. Easier to arrange with the
mouse: settings → widgets, edit mode.

## yami-files.json

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | `"grid"` | `grid` or `list` |
| `zoom` | `2` | icon size in the grid, 0…4 |
| `hidden`, `foldersFirst` | `false`, `true` | |
| `sort`, `desc` | `"name"`, `false` | `name` `size` `time` `type` |
| `thumbs`, `thumbMaxMb` | `true`, `40` | thumbnails, and the largest image to thumbnail, MB |
| `sidebar`, `info` | `true`, `false` | places on the left, details on the right |
| `devices` | `true` | drives, USB sticks, phones and cameras in the sidebar |
| `network` | `true` | the «network» section: mounted shares and «connect…» |
| `servers` | `[]` | addresses you connected to (`smb://nas/media`, `sftp://me@host/`), never with a password; one click mounts them again |
| `terminal` | `"kitty"` | «open terminal here» |
| `confirmTrash`, `singleClick`, `split` | `false` | |
| `width`, `height` | `1060`, `660` | window size at start |

Phones, cameras and network shares go through gvfs (`gio mount`): the packages `gvfs-mtp`
(Android), `gvfs-gphoto2` (cameras), `gvfs-afc` (iPhone) and `gvfs-smb` (Windows shares) add the
backends; sftp, ftp and WebDAV are in gvfs itself. A password is asked in the window and handed
to `gio` over a pipe; it is not stored. Kernel mounts (cifs, nfs, sshfs, rclone) show up too.

Its shortcuts are the usual ones (Ctrl+C/X/V, F2, Delete, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+L, Ctrl+H …) and match by
key position, so they work in any keyboard layout.

## yami-play

`yami-play [FILE|DIR|URL…]` plays every format ffmpeg knows through libmpv (the `mpv` package,
loaded at run time). One file opens its folder as a playlist in natural order. The position is
remembered in `~/.local/state/yami/play/` and frames are saved to the Pictures folder.
Keys: space pause, ←/→ 5 s (Shift 1 s, Ctrl 30 s), ↑/↓ or the wheel volume, F fullscreen, M mute,
N/P next/previous, [ ] speed, A audio track, S subtitles, L repeat, X pixel scaling, C save a
frame, `,` `.` frame step, 1…9 jump to 10…90 %, I details, Q quit. `YAMI_PLAY_OPTS="hwdec=no,…"`
passes extra mpv options. The look (palette, language, font) is the viewer's (`fontView`).
